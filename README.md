# image_copyright_editor
This app is made to change metadata (specifically copyright info) on a bulk of images.

1. Drag and drop bulk images from a directory to a frame
2. Enter the new copyright tag in the input below
3. Click `Save`

The output will be saved in a newly created directory called `updated` with exact same copy of the images dragged to a program.

Packages used
- `os` for directory reading & writing
- `tkinter` for easy GUI setup
- `tkinterDnD` for drag & drop functionality
- `exif` for image metadata reading & writing

TODO:
1. Restrict files to images only [UPDATED]
2. Show updated images on the frame
3. Reduce unnecessary imports [FIXED]
4. Unusual UAC behaviour while running on earlier windows builds (Visual Redistribute C++ may be required?) [FIXED]





NOTE: 
If you encounter problems with `pyinstaller` while building `tkinter`, try providing library path manually like so

`pyinstaller --onefile --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --add-data "C:/<paython_path>/tkinterDnD;tkinterDnD/" "<script.py>"`

depending on which lib you use it could be either `tkinterDnD` or `tkinterdnd2` which in this case is the former.
